# Kotlin Test - Board Game
## Overview

This is my first project working with Android Studio and the Kotlin language. I was able to learn more about coding in a new language, and was able to use multiple functions and classes to create a simple game.

The program is located in ==boardGame.kt==. This program will prompt the user to choose a board size, then create an ASCII board in the text window. The user will then be able to move a player around the board by inputting new coordinates. Additional pickups may be scattered around the board, and be interacted with to give the player points.

Even though the project is incomplete (so far), it proved to be a good base project that allowed me to learn how to create classes, functions, and algorithms in Kotlin. Additional work can be done by using Android Studio to create an Android application version, which would require more learning about the visual libraries and the Android emulator.

## Future Work

- Label format only works for up to 9 rows
- Generate Pickups
  - Spread based on board size
  - Keep certain number on the field
- Visuals, sprites and animations
- Better UI
- End goal for the game
- Sound effects/audio
- Android Emulator
